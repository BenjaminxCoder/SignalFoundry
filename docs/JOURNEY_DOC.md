## Introduction
SignalFoundry is an event-driven analytics platform built to showcase **real-world engineering skills**:  
- Scalable distributed system design  
- Job orchestration with RabbitMQ  
- Analytics computation pipelines (Python)  
- High-performance APIs (Go)  
- Observability, documentation, and CI/CD best practices

This document captures **our entire engineering journey** â€” sprints, experiments, design trade-offs, and technical mastery.

## Sprint Log

### Sprint 1: Foundation (Aug 23 â€“ Aug 29, 2025)
**Goal:** Deliver a minimal working pipeline: API publishes a job â†’ RabbitMQ routes â†’ Python worker consumes â†’ PostgreSQL stores data.

**Key Tasks:**
- âœ… Repo scaffold (.gitignore, .env.example, README)
- ðŸ”„ Docker Compose setup (Postgres, RabbitMQ)
- ðŸ”„ Initial DB migrations
- ðŸ”„ API `/health` endpoint
